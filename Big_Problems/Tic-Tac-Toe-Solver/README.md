# TicTacToeAI

Welcome to Impossible Tic-Tac-Toe. Despite having a fascinating algorithm behind it, the gameplay is not so fun since you are bound to either lose or tie with the AI :).

The tic tac toe AI is created by implementing the "minimax" algorithm. The technique "Alpha-beta pruning" is also used for reducing search space. After overcoming the learning curve of the minimax algorithm, this project proves to be a great introduction to artificial intelligence and game theory. It is a self-motivated project for my passion in the field of artificial intelligence. (more will come)
                                          
> Edit from a year later: lol I really predicted myself on that one. Checkout my work on CV, NLP, and even RL. 

This video explains the minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning. It has been the main learning source for me to fully comprehend this algorithm and implement it myself.

# Getting Started

- Copy-paste TTT-AI.py into a python 3.0 IDE or TTT-AI.cpp into a C++ IDE and press run. 
- The theme in "\_config.yml" do not have to be used but it does look pretty good :).
- Interact with the game in the display window. Note that detailed comments are included in the .py file.
